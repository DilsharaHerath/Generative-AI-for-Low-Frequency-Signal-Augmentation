# Generative-AI-for-Low-Frequency-Signal-Augmentation

## Problem Statement:

Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) signals (typically < 30 kHz) are crucial for applications like drone detection, underground communication, and ionospheric studies. However, real-world data collection in this frequency range is challenging due to:

- Environmental noise (e.g., power lines, atmospheric noise).
- Limited availability of labeled datasets for training machine learning models.
- Expensive and time-consuming data collection using specialized antennas and sensors.

This data scarcity limits the development of robust AI-driven signal processing models for drone detection and other applications.

## Proposed Solution:
We propose using Generative AI (such as Variational Autoencoders, GANs, or Diffusion Models) to synthesize realistic ELF/VLF signals that mimic real-world data distributions. The generated signals can:
- Augment Training Datasets: By generating synthetic low-frequency signals, we can increase the amount of training data for machine learning models used in drone detection.
- Enhance Anomaly Detection: Generative models can simulate rare or difficult-to-capture drone signals, improving AI-based classification accuracy.
- Denoise Real Signals: Generative AI can help reconstruct clean versions of noisy ELF signals, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection algorithms.

## Expected Outcomes:

- A high-quality synthetic ELF signal dataset for drone detection research.
- Improved machine learning model accuracy by training with augmented data.
- A novel approach to low-frequency signal processing using Generative AI.
